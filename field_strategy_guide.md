# Field Strategy Guide: Solar Lead Generation
## Okehampton, Devon (EX20) | February 2026

**Team:** 4 members (2 experienced closers, 2 trainees) | **Vehicles:** 2 cars
**Duration:** Tuesday evening arrival → Thursday evening departure
**Base:** Okehampton, Devon (EX20)

## Executive Summary

This 2-day door-knocking campaign targets high-potential areas within 70 minutes of Okehampton for Hometree Finance 25-year hybrid solar + battery leases. Devon presents exceptional opportunity:

- **10% of Devon homes already have solar** (double the UK average of 4.6%), demonstrating market acceptance
- **High electricity consumption** in rural areas: EX20 averages 4,200 kWh/year vs UK average 3,449 kWh
- **71% owner-occupation** in West Devon (vs 65% England average)
- **11% off-gas-grid** in Torridge & West Devon (vs 8.6% GB average) = high electric heating bills
- **Excellent irradiance**: 1,237 kWh/m² in Exeter area (13% above national average)

**Estimated Potential:** With 400-600 doors across 2 days and a 10-20% appointment rate, expect **40-120 qualified appointments** for technical supervisors.

### Priority Zones (Ranked)
1. **EX20** (Okehampton local) - High consumption, 71% ownership, familiar territory
2. **EX17** (Crediton) - 15-20 min drive, 4,368 kWh mean, good density

- 1960s-1990s semi-detached and detached homes
- Pitched roofs with south/south-west/south-east orientation
- Minimal shading from trees/buildings
- Driveways (indicates ownership)
- Oil tanks visible (confirms off-gas = high bills)

## 5. Tactics for Maximum Conversion

### 5.1 Opening Script (15-20 seconds)

> "Good [morning/afternoon], I'm [Name] from [Company]. We're in the area helping homeowners like yourself reduce their electricity bills by £150-300 per month with a fully-maintained solar and battery system - completely free to install. Do you own this property?"

**If YES:** "Brilliant. Have you looked into solar before, or is this something new?"

**If NO (renter):** "No problem at all. Do you know if your landlord might be interested? [Get details or move on]"

### 5.2 Quick Pre-Qualification (30 seconds)

Ask these three questions early:
1. **"Do you own this property?"** (MUST be yes)
2. **"Is your roof south-facing, or does it get good sun?"** (Ideal: south/SW/SE, pitched)
3. **"What's your electricity bill like at the moment?"** (Higher = better fit)

**Disqualify if:** Renter, flat, heavy shading, north-facing only, recent solar installation

### 5.3 Key Pain Points (Devon Rural Specific)

| Pain Point | Pitch Angle |
|------------|-------------|
| Off-gas electric heating | "You're paying premium rates to heat your home. This system cuts that dramatically." |
| High winter bills | "Imagine your January bill being half what it was - that's what we're seeing." |
| Oil price volatility | "Unlike oil, the sun doesn't have price shocks. Lock in savings for 25 years." |
| Energy independence | "With batteries, you're covered even during power cuts - common in rural areas." |
| House value | "Solar adds 4-14% to property value according to recent studies." |

### 5.4 Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I'm too old / won't be here 25 years" | "The lease transfers with the property - it's actually a selling point for buyers. And you'll see savings from day one." |
| "What's the catch?" | "Fair question. We get paid by Hometree, not you. Your only commitment is the monthly lease, which is fixed to rise only 2.5% per year - less than inflation." |
| "I need to think about it" | "Absolutely. Can I book a 30-minute appointment for our technical team to show you exactly what you'd save? No obligation, just the numbers." |
| "I've had bad experiences with solar salespeople" | "I understand. This isn't about pushy sales - it's a straightforward lease. You'll meet our technical team who'll design the system properly." |
| "Already have solar" | "Great choice! Do you have batteries? We can often add storage to existing systems. Also - know any neighbours who might be interested?" |

### 5.5 Closing for Appointment

> "Based on what you've told me, you'd be a great fit. Our technical supervisor [Name] can visit this week or next to design your system and show you the exact savings. Would [Day] morning or afternoon work better?"

**Appointment confirmation:**
- Get mobile number
- Confirm address
- Note roof orientation, property type
- Ask about EPC rating if known
- Schedule SMS reminder
