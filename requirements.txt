The project involves gathering information, analysing it and producing a detailed report for a lead generation and sales company responsible for finding and selling a hybrid solar panels and battery package to UK households (which also includes Levelise and Snugg as free extras for households to profit). The overall idea is that, since electricity bills are so high in the UK, and since these are costs which households will always have, there exists a scheme offered via Hometree Finance to allow households to sign up for 25 year leases of this equipment, and only having to pay a monthly fee. Since the system is capable of selling energy back to the grid, and will be set up to maximise savings (and has the added profits from Levelise and Snugg), the total reduction in energy costs plus the additional profits from selling energy back to the grid plus the additional profits from the Snugg carbon credit scheme, subtract the monthly subscription cost of the lease of the solar panels, batteries and inverter, should still be a positive number. All of the equipment is fully covered including repairs, parts and maintenance, with no call out charges and thus no risk to the consumers. The lease cost increases at 2.5% per annum which is lower than historical inflation, and thus is quite reasonable. Our team uses Opensolar to design the solar array and to model the energy savings, additional to the ability to compare savings across switching to different tariffs (which would be a necessary step in the process in order to be able to profit from the hybrid system) and EPVS (energy performance validation scheme) which offers benchmarking and a calculator the verity the numbers generated by opensolar. The company who installs the panels and the system is Emerald Solar. Hometree finance pays Emerald Solar and then Emerald Solar pays us. We will be knocking on doors (and possibly doing digital marketing) to find initial leads of households interested in entering this deal (reducing monthly household outgoings, future proofing home, increasing house value, environmental benefits, etc), and if they are interested we will set up an appointment for one of our technical supervisors to sit and talk through this arrangement in more detail, design and price the system, and have the homeowners agree to sign up to a 25 year hometree lease.
Now, we want to sign up as many households as possible. There is a minimum requirement for hometree finance, which is that in the first year, 6% of the initial outlay is paid back by the system in terms of the value of the energy generation. For example, a £20,000 system must generate £1200 of energy in the first year. In this way, there is some minimum threshold for the size and payback of the system which normally means at least 10 solar panels (Jinko tiger neo all black 455W), two 5.8kWh batteries, and a 3.7kW inverter (if below 14 panels) or a larger inverter (n.b the larger inverter will requite a G99 form instead of a G98 form and thus can take up to 45 days to be processed).
As both lead generators and field sales consultants/representatives, we wish to maximise the amount of money that can be made from this scheme. We thus wish to target areas of the UK where we can sign up as many houses as quickly as possible. As long as houses meet the minimum 6% payback in the first year (as well as Hometree's calculations for creditworthiness), they will qualify and we will be able to get paid. It is not the case that we get paid more for houses that save more money, only that these households themselves will be able to save more money on their monthly outgoing expenditures, which may make it more likely for them to agree to the deal.
With this background information, the research query should use as much information as possible to be able to find out the areas in the UK that will be the best for the lead generators and sales team to target. In particular, our pioneer team will be travelling to Mid Devon, and staying in Okehampton. There are 4 team members, and there will be two experienced door knockers (who will also be the ones closing leads), and two inexperienced trainee door knockers, who will be receiving training. 
As an example of some decent initial research, Business Energy UK produced a report on the postcodes that use the most energy in the UK, using the following methodology:"To discover the postcodes, postcode districts and cities that use the most electricity annually in the UK, we looked at the latest Gov.uk dataset from the Department of Energy. (The Gov.uk dataset does not include data for Northern Irish postcodes.)
 
We ranked postcodes with at least 10 electricity meters (households) and postcode districts with at least 1,000 meters.
 
Grouping the postcodes into cities also allowed us to calculate the average annual electricity consumption by city.
 
To estimate the average annual spend by postcode, postcode district and city, we used electricity rates by region from uSwitch<a href="https://www.uswitch.com/gas-electricity/guides/why-are-energy-rates-different-by-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"></a> in conjunction with each location’s annual electricity consumption."

There also exist tools and datasets such as https://www.nongasmap.org.uk, EPC data, as well as many other open datasets on energy usage and energy efficiency of households. Do there also exist datasets that can provide insight as to the suitability of solar panels for households across the UK? The houses must be owned and not rental properties.
If there is anything else that might be necessary to consider, think about this here and make a note in the research query.
To conclude, the main point that is to be answered is which areas will be most suitable for a 2-4 person team to visit in order to maximise the amount of money that can be made by successfully signing up households to 25 year hometree finance leases for hybrid solar systems. Produce a prompt for an LLM to produce a research report with a detailed, step-by-step methodology that provides actionable insights.


Granularity of Key Data

Household electricity consumption: Highly granular. DESNZ publishes domestic electricity consumption at postcode level (full postcodes with sufficient meters, typically 10+ households for privacy), as well as LSOA (Lower Layer Super Output Areas, ~1,000–3,000 people), MSOA, and local authority levels. The 2024 data (released December 2025) includes mean/median kWh per household, distributions, and totals. This allows precise identification of high-consumption streets or sectors.
Home ownership (owner-occupation): Less granular publicly. English Housing Survey (EHS) provides national/regional breakdowns (e.g., 65% England, higher in South East/South West/rural ~70–85% in some LAs), but not routinely at postcode or LSOA level. Proxies come from Census 2021 tenure data (updated occasionally) or local authority estimates. For field strategy, local authority or ward-level ONS tenure stats serve as the best public proxy; exact postcode ownership often requires proprietary tools (e.g., Experian/credit data) or on-the-ground verification.
Solar PV suitability/potential: Medium-high granularity. Global Solar Atlas offers ~250m–1km resolution irradiance/PVOUT maps (kWh/kWp), downloadable as GIS layers. Rooftop-specific tools (e.g., proxies from Ordnance Survey or Advanced Infrastructure) are often commercial, but public EPC registers include roof type/orientation at address level (though not always linked directly to irradiance).
Off-gas-grid properties: Very granular. DESNZ provides LSOA-level estimates (% and counts of properties without gas meters), updated annually (2024 data December 2025). nongasmap.org.uk visualizes this down to postcode for registered users.
Existing solar deployment: Moderate granularity. Energy Saving Trust hotspots give per-10,000-people rates by local authority or district (2025 data); MCS data is installation-level but aggregated regionally.

Overall, electricity consumption and off-gas-grid data support street/postcode-sector targeting; ownership and roof suitability often require LA-level filtering + field scouting.
Field Strategy Document: Additional Useful Information and Approach
To create a practical "Field Strategy" document (e.g., weekly/daily visit plans for a 2–4 person team), the current report's regional/postcode-cluster recommendations provide a strong foundation, but more detail would enhance it significantly. Ideal structure: 13–26 week rolling plan, starting in one high-scoring cluster (e.g., East of England), with daily routes of 100–200 doors in walkable streets.
Additional information that would be highly useful (ranked by impact):

Postcode-sector level data extracts:
Top 50–100 postcode sectors (e.g., NR1 1xx, EX4 1xx) ranked by composite score (high consumption + high ownership proxy + good irradiance + low flats % from EPC).
Number of domestic meters/owner-occupied estimates per sector (from DESNZ + Census proxies).

Street-level or ward-level filters:
Housing stock type (e.g., % detached/semi-detached vs. flats from EPC register or ONS).
Avoid high-density flats/high-rises (low roof suitability).
Google Maps/Street View proxies for roof orientation/space (south-facing prevalence in suburbs).

Existing solar saturation at finer scale:
MCS installation counts per postcode sector (publicly queryable) or Energy Saving Trust granular hotspots to skip oversaturated streets.

Demographic/creditworthiness proxies:
Average household income or ACORN/ Mosaic profiles per postcode (commercial, e.g., via CACI) – for Hometree approval likelihood.
Fuel poverty rates (DESNZ) – high-poverty areas may have motivation but lower credit scores.

Logistics and efficiency data:
Drive/walk times between sectors (Google Maps API estimates).
Population density + qualifying home density per km².
Local weather/seasonal factors (e.g., avoid winter knocking for lower conversion).

Lead qualification signals:
Areas with recent high energy bill complaints (social media proxies or forums).
Proximity to existing Emerald Solar installs (for testimonials/referrals).

Competitor/regulation notes:
G98 vs. G99 inverter thresholds per area (to avoid delays).
Local council solar policies or community schemes.



######################### Begin Task #####################
You are an expert field sales strategist specializing in UK door-to-door lead generation for zero-upfront-cost solar + battery lease schemes (similar to Hometree Finance models). Your goal is to produce an ultra-detailed, hyper-actionable "Field Strategy Guide" for a 4-person team (2 cars available) staying in Okehampton, Devon (postcode EX20) from Tuesday evening to Thursday evening in early 2026.
The team is door-knocking to generate leads for 25-year Hometree Finance leases of hybrid solar PV + battery systems (min ~10 Jinko panels + 2x batteries, full maintenance, Levelise export optimization + Snugg carbon credits extras). Success = maximizing qualified appointments set for technical supervisors (target 10–20% knock-to-appointment rate, leading to sign-ups). Payment is per sign-up volume, so prioritize density of owner-occupied, suitable-roof homes likely to hit 6% first-year payback and convert quickly due to high bills/savings appeal.
Critical Context & Qualification Filters (use these to prioritize):

Must be owner-occupied (not rented/social housing).
Sufficient roof space/orientation/shading for ≥6% payback (typically south-ish facing pitched roofs on detached/semi-detached).
High electricity consumption = stronger savings pitch (self-consumption + export + extras - 2.5% escalating lease = positive net).
Favor off-gas-grid homes (expensive electric heating = massive bill pain).
Avoid high saturation (skepticism/competition), flats/high-rise, shaded/poor roofs.

Latest Data Summary (Feb 2026 – embed & cite these):

Region Fit: South West England ranks #2 nationally in our scoring model (85/100). Devon has excellent overlap: high off-gas-grid (South West ~24% England highest; rural Devon often 30–50%+ per DESNZ 2024 LSOA data Dec 2025 & nongasmap.org.uk), good irradiance (Global Solar Atlas: Devon PVOUT ~1,000–1,200 kWh/kWp, higher sunlight than most UK counties per Sunsave Energy Jan 2026), high owner-occupation (rural Devon LAs 70–85%+ per English Housing Survey 2024–25 headline reports Dec 2025/Jan 2026; England avg 65%).
Electricity Consumption: DESNZ postcode-level domestic electricity 2024 (released Dec 18, 2025) shows South West regional mean above GB average due to off-gas electric heating. Rural EX/PL/TQ sectors often higher (proxied from subnational reports).
Solar Hotspots & Saturation: Energy Saving Trust UK solar hotspots (Dec 12, 2025) – Devon districts top England: Central Devon (633 installs/10,000 people), South Devon (609), Torridge/North Devon high; Mid/West Devon moderate-high adoption (~5% homes with solar per older proxies, but vast untapped rural/suburban). Avoid ultra-hotspots like parts of Cornwall.
Local Around Okehampton (EX20, West Devon/Mid Devon border): Rural/suburban profile = high qualifying density (detached/semi-detached, pitched roofs, off-gas pockets). Over 48,000 Devon homes have solar (Sunsave Jan 2026), but room for growth. EX20 likely strong off-gas & consumption.
Drivable Areas from Okehampton Base (2 cars, ~30–45 min radius for efficiency): EX20 (local), EX21/EX22 (North Devon), EX17 (Crediton), PL19 (Tavistock), TQ13 (Dartmoor edge), parts of EX15/EX16 if viable.

Task: Produce the Field Strategy Guide
Structure it professionally with these sections. Be ultra-specific: name postcode sectors, example streets/suburbs, daily routes, car splits, KPIs. Maximize edge by cross-referencing data for highest-probability zones.

Executive Summary: Why this short trip can yield strong results; estimated potential appointments/sign-ups; key priority zones.
Preparation (Tuesday Evening Arrival):
Team setup in Okehampton.
Data review: Prioritize postcode sectors (e.g., top EX20 sectors for consumption/off-gas proxy).
Tools: Tablets with Opensolar for quick roof scans/demos, pitch scripts emphasizing "£150–300+/month bill reduction risk-free".
Street scouting via Google Maps/Street View (instruct team to pre-mark south-facing semis/detached streets).

Priority Targeting Methodology (step-by-step how you selected zones):
Rank local/drivable postcode sectors by: high off-gas proxy (rural EX/PL), owner-occupation, moderate saturation, roof suitability (pitched rural homes), consumption (rural electric heating boost).
Top 5–8 sectors with rationale (e.g., EX20 1–9 for local density, PL19 Tavistock suburbs).

Daily Plans:
Wednesday (Full Day 1): Split into 2 pairs (1 car each). Detailed routes (e.g., Pair 1: EX20 southern suburbs – specific streets like Crediton Road areas; Pair 2: Drive to Crediton EX17 select sectors). Timings, door targets (80–120/person), lunch/rotate.
Thursday (Full Day 2): Adjust based on Day 1 learnings; higher-potential zones (e.g., Tavistock PL19 or Northlew EX20 off-gas pockets). Follow-up any hot leads.
Logistics: Parking, walkable streets, weather contingencies, evening debriefs in Okehampton.

Tactics for Maximum Conversion Edge:
Street selection: Favor 1960s–1990s semis/detached cul-de-sacs.
Objection handling tailored to rural Devon (e.g., off-gas pain, farming homes).
Quick pre-qual: "Do you own? South roof? High bills?"
KPIs & tracking.

Risks & Optimizations: G99 delays, saturation pockets, credit issues; next steps post-trip.

Use tables for daily routes/postcode rankings. Be realistic for a small team (400–600 doors total across 2 days). Focus on volume in dense qualifying streets. Output in clear markdown.
